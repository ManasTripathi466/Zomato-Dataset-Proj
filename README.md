📊 Zomato Data Analysis Project

This is my first data analysis project, where I worked with the Zomato dataset to gain insights into restaurant data.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats to prepare it for analysis.

Data Visualization: Created meaningful charts and graphs using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data.

Insights & Questions Solved: Answered several real-world business questions such as:

Which cities have the highest number of restaurants?

What are the top cuisines?

Which restaurants have the best ratings?

And more...



🧠 Skills Applied:

Data preprocessing using Pandas

Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Problem solving and interpretation of results


This project helped me build a strong foundation in data analytics and visualization, and it marks the beginning of my journey in data science.
